<p>	Personal biography is the personal information to all people but not to them that have the reputation or they that came from the well-known family. This because, everyone wants to know about them like what they do, with who they date, about their family and others personal information. In the personal biography, there also key features about them. The key features or it called by the main characteristic is a natural thing that have in our body.</p>
<p>	The main characteristics of a person can be seen from various angles. For example, through his actions or inclinations when doing a job. I have many key features of myself. First and foremost, I have skills in social media. For example, I have several social media accounts and all of them I use to interact with my friends in cyberspace. My skills in social media started when I started using social media as my main device in finding all the information about the things that I want to know, and I am also interested in using social media.</p>
<P>	Next, I also have skills in playing extreme sports because for me this sport gives me pleasure and can calm my soul and mind that is a little confused because thinking a lot of things. Not only that, I can also relieve stress when I do this activity. This is because, this extreme sports sport taught me a lot in dealing with every problem I have because every problem I have, I will let go when playing extreme sports.</P>
<p>	Besides, I also have good working in groups because when working in groups, we will be able to solve all the unanswered questions because everyone will give their views and ideas in helping the groups to answer all the questions. Not only that, working in groups requires a lot of patience because we will not know about the behavior or problems of each member of our group.
<p>	In conclusion, the key features of a person will be seen from all his actions and from his character because every act done will be viewed and evaluated by others because they will evaluate every act done so that we will know the strengths and weaknesses in us.</p>
